# Rl garage assets
Bot created with the sole intention of generating a list of all the thumbnails of the rocket league assets.

Due to the encryption of the original files, I collect all the data and images, from [RL Garage](https://rocket-league.com/items)

### Example output

 - Map of items with information: https://github.com/kaiserdj/rl-garage-assets/blob/main/output/data.json
	 
   Raw: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaiserdj/rl-garage-assets/main/output/data.json
 - List thumbnails: https://github.com/kaiserdj/rl-garage-assets/tree/main/output/assets
